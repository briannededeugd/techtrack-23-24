			As we've seen in the data, women haven't been entirely invisible in the
			twentieth century film world. Though they weren't winning Oscars at the
			time, they've always been present at the writer's table and behind the
			camera.

			In 100 years, the percentage women make up in the crews of movies made has
			grown from a mere 4.68% to 12.13%, and since 1985 women have been getting
			nominated for Best Director and Best Cinematography at the Oscars! And
			although the numbers may not be very large yet, the journey we have just
			now taken through time proves that there's a steady increase in female
			representation in film.<br />

			<br />I hope these visualisations motivate you to pay more attention to
			who is making your movies, and what that means for how that movie turned
			out in the end. After all, women can do anything.
