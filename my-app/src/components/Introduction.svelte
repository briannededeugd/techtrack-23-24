    <h1>Female Representation in Cinema</h1>
    <h3>By Brianne de Deugd for the minor Information Design, Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences</h3>
    <p>Have you ever heard of the Bechdel Test? It's also known by its longer name, 'The Bechdel-Wallace Test',
        and measures the representation of women in pieces of fiction. The test poses the question, <em>Does this work
        feature at least two women who are having a conversation about something other than a man?</em> This test has
        altered the manner in which countless people watch movies, and how they rate them. And it has prompted further questions,
        such as <em>What percentage of Oscar-winning people were women?</em></p>
    
    <p>Today, we will explore the answers to these questions in a visual manner, in order to acquaint ourselves with the numbers our women make up in this large industry.
