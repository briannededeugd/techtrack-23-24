Welcome to my project for the Tech Track of the minor Information Design, "Female Representation in Cinema", an interactive data visualisation telling the story of women in film during the past 100 years.

### How to get to _Female Representation in Cinema_
You're lucky! [My data visualisation site is up and running via Vercel](https://techtrack-2324.vercel.app/). If you'd rather run it on localhost, there's a few things you've got to do:

1. Download the folder `my-app` from the [Code page](https://github.com/briannededeugd/techtrack-23-24);
2. Open your Command Line Interface (Terminal);
3. Navigate to your Downloads folder using `cd Downloads` (meaning Change Directories to Downloads);<br>
3a. OPTIONAL: Type `pwd` to check what folder you're in. This should return Downloads.<br>
3b. OPTIONAL: Type `ls` to check the contents of your Downloads folder. This returns a list that should include `my-app`.<br>
4. Navigate to the `my-app` folder using `cd my-app` (meaning Change Directories to my-app);
5. Type `npm i` to install all necessary npm dependencies (pieces of other people's code the project depends on);
6. Type `npm run dev` to initialize the app. This should return `Running on localhost:[XXXX]`, in which `[XXXX]` is a four-digit number.
7. Open a browser (preferably FireFox, but Chrome works, too) and navigate to the address `localhost:[XXXX]` that was returned.

Now you should be able to view and use the application!
